Styling will be done later (dragon image, color scheme, etc.)

"Derrick - You just need change the formatting of the page such that
it is laid out similarly to the image shared before.
Don't worry about the database set up stuff."


Current Tasks:

- Functionality is complete, but I NEED TO ADD SOME COMMENTARY AND
UNDERSTAND THE CODE. Otherwise I am confused, and also cannot
explain it to teammates while we implement mongoDB
- We need to talk with teammates to integrate the save function
into mongoDB.


- Styling is still needed, but I don't think we have time.
		Just get the dragon image placed in the placeholder.


Other Things:
	Write a Note (may not have time)
	Victory Screen? (Seen on line 40 "{remainingHP}")

Steven said he will do backend things.
And seriously hurry up.

And I need to learn the React debug tools, I need to learn how to
parse what is actually going on in development code...
....and probably leave coding. It's WAY too fucking hard.
I daydream, I kind of am consistently spacing out.
...Maybe I've been in my mom's house for way too fucking long...
will come back to coding when I move out.
My brain just doesn't function like it used to...
